Testing of a NodeMCU (ESP8266MOD Chip, D1 mini board) with a GooouuuTech GT-U7 GPS Receiver via 3 PINS (TX, GND, VCC) running at 3.3V via Micro USB connector.  
Debug is possible with Micro USB on GT-U7 while also monitoring via NodeMCU.  
Needs to be outside, as it seems to have issues getting enough SAT signals to provide Lat/Log cordinates indoors.
